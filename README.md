# Wind Turbine Data Analysis

In this project, we analyzed wind turbine data from Turkey to gain insights into the performance and efficiency of a wind turbine. We used Python and various libraries to clean, explore, and visualize the data.


### Data

The data used in this project is the Wind Turbine SCADA dataset from Kaggle. It contains information about the turbine's power output, wind speed, wind direction, and other variables collected at regular intervals.

### Conclusion

The analysis revealed the trend of increasing average power output over time, identified maximum and minimum power output, the time of the day with the highest power generation and the impact of wind direction on power output. These insights can help improve the wind farm's efficiency and effectiveness.
